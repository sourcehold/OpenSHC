# DirectDraw and DirectPlay Dependencies

The August 2007 SDK was the last version of the DirectX SDK that included the headers and libraries for both DirectDraw and DirectPlay.
This folder only contains the headers and libraries for DirectDraw and DirectPlay, no other contents of the SDK. All present licenses are still included.

The files itself were taken from this Github Repository: [DirectX SDK Collection](https://github.com/NovaRain/DXSDK_Collection)
