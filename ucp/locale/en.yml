general_descr: "This module is a work-in-progress version of the reimplementation of Stronghold Crusader.
  Depending on the current state, some calls will actually call the reimplemented versions instead of the original.

  ince the aim is to provide the same functionality as the game. Changes in behavior are actually bugs and should be reported to the team.
  Compatibility to other modules is no goal. There are no safety checks and sudden conflicts with other modules might quickly arise, including crashes."
