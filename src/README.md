# src/
These folders contain the source code to be compiled.

There are two main subfolders: original, reimplementation. The layout of these folders should mirror each other as much as possible.

## Usage
Code in the original folder provides an interface to the existing game binary.

Code in the reimplementation folder provides the reimplementation.
