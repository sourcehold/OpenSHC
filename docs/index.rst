Welcome to OpenSHC!
===================

**OpenSHC** is an open-source reimplementation of the beloved classic game
**Stronghold Crusader** by Firefly Studios. Our goal is to recreate the gameplay,
mechanics, and feel of the original, while making the codebase modern, moddable,
and accessible to everyone.
