About
===========

**OpenSHC** is an open-source reimplementation of the beloved classic game
**Stronghold Crusader** by Firefly Studios. Our goal is to recreate the gameplay,
mechanics, and feel of the original, while making the codebase modern, moddable,
and accessible to everyone.

Aims
====
.. _About_Aims:

The two main aims are:

.. _Aim1:

#. Replicating the original game's machine code using new C++ source code, producing a faithful reimplementation
#. Providing modding opportunities in the new source code

The project is considered complete when :ref:`Aim 1<Aim1>` has been reached.

How
=====

The reimplementation is achieved by closely studying the original game and the machine code, using various software tools.

Then, the game is reimplemented by writing new source code for every function, every data structure, and every variable.

Outputs
=========

While the reimplementation is underway, Windows DLL files are released that provides new improved functionalities for the game.

For example, API functions are added to provide modding access to reimplemented parts.
