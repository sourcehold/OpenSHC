# OpenSHC - AI Agent Guide

## Overview

OpenSHC is an open-source reimplementation of **Stronghold Crusader 1.41**.

The project builds as a DLL that hooks into the original game, progressively replacing original functions with native C++ implementations. The long-term goal is a complete, maintainable, binary-compatible reimplementation.

## Build

- Build system: **CMake**
- Compiler: **MSVC (x86)**

A compatible MSVC toolchain (`MSVC1400-SP1`) is included for consistent code generation. It corresponds to **Visual Studio 2005 SP1**.

Building requires an original **Stronghold Crusader 1.41** installation linked through `_original/`.

## Development Principles

OpenSHC is both a software project and a reverse-engineering effort.

Prioritize:

- correct game behaviour
- binary compatibility
- maintainable C++

Decompiler output, imported symbols, and reconstructed types are valuable references, but are not always authoritative.

Preserve the existing project structure and coding style. Avoid architectural changes or refactoring that alter the existing file and directory structure.

When reimplementing a function, first inspect neighboring implementations and established project patterns. Use decompiler output as a reference, but do not rely on it as the only source of truth.

The C++ level and style is C++98/C++03. Do not use features and structures of C++11 or later.

## Reimplementation Structure

Function and struct resolvers are used as proxies in place of the original game functions and structs.

Reimplementation code interacts with resolvers rather than directly referencing the original symbols. Address identity mismatches are expected when resolvers are inactive and use the original game's addresses.

The following files are primarily generated and should only be modified when explicitly requested:

- `.hpp` files mostly contain generated headers per namespace or class.
- `.hpp` files in `src/OpenSHC/Globals` contain struct resolvers.
- `.func.hpp` files contain function resolvers for functions belonging to a namespace or class.

Implementation code belongs in `.cpp` files:

- Files are named after the function or function group they implement.
- Files are placed in a folder matching the namespace or class of the corresponding header.

## Development Tools

### Implementation Cheat Sheet

The [Implementation Cheat Sheet](IMPLEMENTATION_CHEAT_SHEET.md) is a reference for patterns and oddities of the compiler that are found during the reimplementation process.
Scan this document if you are instructed to reimplement a function.

### MCP Server (`tools/mcp`)

Provides project-specific utilities including:

- retrieving Ghidra decompilations
- compiling individual functions
- comparing generated assembly
- updating local source lists

### Ghidra Import (`tools/import`)

Imports and synchronizes Ghidra-exported data.

### Reimplementation Control (`tools/reimplementation-control`)

Scripts for enabling implementations and maintaining project state.

### Reimplementation Control (`tools/reimplementation-helper`)

Scripts for supporting implementation. Usually already integrated into skills.

### Batch Helpers (`tools/reimplementation-helper/batch`)

Python scripts for working on every function listed in `cmake/openshc-sources.txt.local` at once (see its README):
quiet builds, `/Zs` syntax checks, a reccmp report (match %, normalized % ignoring call targets, snapshots, compact diffs),
showing and splicing many function bodies, one progress commit per changed function, and repairing sources after
`*_Func` namespace refactors. Prefer them over ad-hoc scripts when a task spans many functions.

A second group inspects the original binary to find differences that are not register allocation.
Run them from the batch folder; each takes function names or path substrings and defaults to the whole list:

- `jump_table_order.py [--apply] [NAME...]` compares a state `switch` with the original's jump table and reorders
  the cases. MSVC emits jump-table case bodies in source order, so cases in the wrong order cap the match
  regardless of what the bodies contain. It refuses to move a body that can fall through.
- `compare_constants.py [NAME...]` diffs the sequence of `cmp` constants between the original and our build.
  A `-x / +y` pair one apart is an off-by-one literal, a lone `-x` is a check we are missing, and a run of lines
  moving together means our blocks are in a different order.
- `fix_off_by_one.py [--apply] [NAME...]` rewrites `> 31` to `>= 32` and friends, so the literal matches the one
  the original compares against. Behaviour is unchanged, but it is not always an improvement: verify per function
  and revert the ones that got worse.
- `original_asm.py NAME [--jumptable]` prints the original's disassembly, or its switch case order, for reading
  by hand.

`jump_table_order.py` and `original_asm.py` read the original exe and need `capstone` and `_original/`;
`compare_constants.py` and `fix_off_by_one.py` read `reccmp/dll/diff.json`, so run reccmp first.
Always rebuild and `reccmp_report.py cmp BASE.json` after `--apply`: these are heuristics, not guarantees.

### Binary Comparison (`reccmp`)

Compares generated binaries against the original executable.

## Working on Many Functions

When restyling or improving a large set of functions, work in batches (e.g. per folder) and verify each batch:

1. Save a baseline: `reccmp_report.py --run save base.json`.
2. Rewrite the bodies (`show_functions.py` -> edit -> `splice_functions.py`), then `syntax_check.py` and `build_quiet.py`.
3. Compare with `reccmp_report.py --run cmp base.json`; revert or rework every `WORSE` function and inspect the rest with `diff`.
4. Commit with `commit_progress_batch.py` (100% "Reimplemented" when only call targets differ, otherwise the % with a short blocker remark).

Style expected of reimplemented code:

- Declare variables where they are first used; access fields repeatedly instead of copying them into locals
  (the compiler created the locals), unless the diff shows the original really used a local.
- Use `for` loops (loop variable declared in the `for`), early returns instead of nested if/else, no `goto`,
  no pointer variables walking over arrays or structs, named fields and enum constants instead of offsets and magic numbers.
- Never change the `// FUNCTION:` address line; keep generated headers untouched unless asked.
- Write sources as UTF-8 with LF line endings.

Diff patterns that were reliable (more in the cheat sheet):

- Absolute `DAT_*` addresses in the original asm where the source uses `this->` mean the original accessed the global instance.
- Signed `jl/jge` vs our unsigned `jb/jae` on `undefined4`/`uint` fields: compare through `(int)`.
- `cmp x, N; ja` means `<= N`; write the literal the asm shows.
- `mov r, [x]; sub r, 1; je` inside a loop is a `switch` on `x`.
- A tail call to the same callee from our code but a jump back to a shared block in the original means separate
  `if` branches with identical bodies, not a combined condition.
- Callee-saved registers reused after a call without reload (`ecx`/`edx`) indicate LTCG (`cmake/compiler-flags-gl.txt`),
  not a source difference.
- A mismatching argument count or `ret N` usually means the generated header is wrong; report it instead of working around it.
- Diffs can reveal real bugs in existing reimplementations (wrong constants, wrong strides); fix those.
